---------------------------------------------- C# HASHTABLE CLASS------------------------------------------ 
The Hashtable class represents a collection of key-and-value pairs that are organized based on
the hash code of the key. It uses the key to access the elements in the collection.

A hash table is used when you need to access elements by using key, and you can identify a useful
key value. Each item in the hash table has a key/value pair. The key is used to access the items in
the collection.

Methods and Properties of the Hashtable Class
The following table lists some of the commonly used properties of the Hashtable class:

Property            Description
Count                Gets the number of key-and-value pairs contained in the Hashtable.
IsFixedSize      Gets a value indicating whether the Hashtable has a fixed size.
IsReadOnly      Gets a value indicating whether the Hashtable is read-only.
Item                   Gets or sets the value associated with the specified key.
Keys                   Gets an ICollection containing the keys in the Hashtable.
Values               Gets an ICollection containing the values in the Hashtable.

The following table lists some of the commonly used methods of the Hashtable class:

Sr.No.   Method
1            public virtual void Addobjectkey, objectvalue;
              Adds an element with the specified key and value into the Hashtable.

2            public virtual void Clear;
              Removes all elements from the Hashtable.

3            public virtual bool ContainsKeyobjectkey;
              Determines whether the Hashtable contains a specific key.
 
4            public virtual bool ContainsValueobjectvalue;
              Determines whether the Hashtable contains a specific value.

5            public virtual void Removeobjectkey;
              Removes the element with the specified key from the Hashtable.


Methods           Usage
Add	               Adds an item with a key and value into the hashtable.
Remove            Removes the item with the specified key from the hashtable.
Clear	               Removes all the items from the hashtable.
Contains           Checks whether the hashtable contains a specific key.
ContainsKey	   Checks whether the hashtable contains a specific key.
ContainsValue Checks whether the hashtable contains a specific value.
GetHash	   Returns the hash code for the specified key.

void Add(object key, object value);
